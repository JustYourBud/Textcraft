# Textcraft

A very simple text-based version of Minecraft written in Python, originally generated by Windows Copilot.

## Context

I updated Windows 11 and got access to Copilot (which is literally just Bing Chat for desktop). As a joke I asked it to generate Minecraft but it's literally just a text adventure written in Python. To my surprise it actually wrote a surprisingly (and I use this term loosely) "in-depth", though extremely messy, text-based version of Minecraft. The script randomly generates a world using a list of blocks, and allows the player to move around, dig, place, and craft. There is also an inventory implemented. A smelting function was also written but sadly the AI refused to write the whole thing so it currently doesn't work. I've been messing with the code to see what else can be done with it. This isn't anything I'm taking seriously so the code will probably always be a mess, but I thought it was interesting enough to tinker with and open source for the hell of it.

## How to run

Since everything is in one file and there are no dependencies whatsoever, simply run `py textcraft.py` using Python 3 and the game should start.
